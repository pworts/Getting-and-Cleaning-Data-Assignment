1. Start with a fresh working environment
2. Load the libraries from the course and your preferred cleaning libraries
3. Download the assignment file and unzip the file to explore the contents
4. Make sure the file is in the correct folder and that there is a folder present

6. Make sure each column in labeled appropriately
7. Get the activity levels descriptions integrated into the the data frame
8. Confirm activity name integration success
9. Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the 560ish variables in the data frame
10. Create new data frame with the column labels and mean and sd for each of the variables
11. Export the data frame as a table into a text file for upload and include the row names (even though I put the column numbers as row names)

The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'.

The body acceleration signal is obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample is recorded as radians/second.
