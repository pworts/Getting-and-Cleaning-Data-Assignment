This repo contains a script for downloading the UCI HAR Dataset. This dataset contains three separate files that need to be merged (features, activity, and subject) into a single data set. Additionally, there is a tidy data set that provides the mean and standard deviation for each accelerometer and gyroscope variable (once the three data sets are merged) to offer an overview of the dataset.
